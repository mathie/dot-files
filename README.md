# Mathie's dot-files

This is the current set of dot-files I'm sharing between computers. They're
designed only to work with Mac OS X and only with homebrew installed in
~/.homebrew. In other words, they're designed to work for *me* and me alone.

That said, feel free to find some inspiration. :-)

I've been keeping some or all of my home directory under source control for a
while now, but I'd gotten lazy, recently. I've been experimenting with a bunch
of new tools lately (tmux instead of screen, vim with a bunch of plugins, zsh
instead of bash, that sort of thing), so I decided now was as good a time as
any for a scorched earth time to start again.
